# Changelog

Notable changes to Venya will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `venya store --key-version`: explicit key version ID to encrypt with.
  Fresh installs have no active key version yet — pass `--key-version v1`
  until key-version bootstrap lands.

### Fixed

- `venya store` now sends the required `key_version_id`; previously every
  store failed with HTTP 422 on every server. Without `--key-version`, the
  CLI resolves the server's active key version
  (`GET /api/v1/key-versions/active`); a failed lookup (fresh install, 503)
  exits loudly with a `--key-version` hint and writes nothing.

### Removed

- `venya store --force`: silent no-op — the server never accepted a `force`
  field and has no upsert semantics. Storing an existing key creates a new
  row; delete the old secret first when replacing one.
