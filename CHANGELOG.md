# Changelog

Notable changes to Venya will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- macOS support for the Workstation CLI: config dir follows the platform
  convention (`~/Library/Application Support/venya`), and the CLI installer
  runs on stock macOS (`shasum` fallback for hash verification, no
  `readlink -f` dependency, Linux-only `/dev/hidraw` check replaced with an
  IOKit note). Verified on macOS 26.6.2 arm64 with a full FIDO2 login
  round-trip.
- `venya store --key-version`: explicit key version ID to encrypt with.
  Fresh installs have no active key version yet — pass `--key-version v1`
  until key-version bootstrap lands.

### Fixed

- CLI installer day-one printout: now lists `venya init <user-id>` (creates
  the first admin account, FIDO2 key required) before `venya login` —
  previously an operator following the printout attempted login with no
  account.
- `venya store` now sends the required `key_version_id`; previously every
  store failed with HTTP 422 on every server. Without `--key-version`, the
  CLI resolves the server's active key version
  (`GET /api/v1/key-versions/active`); a failed lookup (fresh install, 503)
  exits loudly with a `--key-version` hint and writes nothing.

### Removed

- `venya store --force`: silent no-op — the server never accepted a `force`
  field and has no upsert semantics. Storing an existing key creates a new
  row; delete the old secret first when replacing one.
